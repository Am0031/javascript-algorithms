# javascript-algorithms

![MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue)

This project compiles a variety of functions and corresponding tests using javascript, ode.js and the jest package

## Folder structure

All works are located in the `src` folder. The `src` folder contained a folder per function/algorithms. The names of the folders match the items listed below.

Each function folder contains at least a readme with more explanations for the specific function, a .js file with the function and a .test.js for the corresponding jest testing.

## Functions and algorithms

### Numbers

- oddOrEven: check if number is odd or event
- isPerfectSquare: check if a number is a perfect square number or not
- isPrimeNumber: check if a number is a prime number
- factorial: returns the factorial of a given positive number, or 1 when given 0, or undefined when given a negative number
- mostSongs: return the maximum number of elements present in the array, with a maximum sum of 60
- fizzBuzz: goes through the numbers 1 to 100 and for each number: replaces it by `Fizz` if the number is divisable by num1, replaces it by `Buzz` if the number is divisable by num2, replaces it by `FizzBuzz` if the number is divisable by both num1 and num2, or keeps the number itself, and then returns the complete string of results for all numbers.

### Strings

- isAnagram: check if two strings are anagrams (same letters)
- isPalindrome: check if a string is a palindrome (same word when written backwards)
- camelCase: changes the format of a string to a camel case format
- titleCase: changes the format of a string to a title case format
- vowelCount: returns the total number of vowels present in a string

### Arrays

- isUnique: check if array contains only unique numbers
- arraySearch2D: returns the number of times a specific character
  is present in the 2D array
- largestNumber: returns the largest number in an array of numbers
- productOfLargestTwo: finds the largest two numbers in an array and returns the product of these numbers
- sumArray: returns the sum of all the numbers in the array
- sieve of Eratosthenes: finds the prime numbers in a range of numbers and returns the array of prime numbers
- linearSearch: returns the index of the first occurence of a given number in an array of numbers, or -1 if the given number is not in the array
- binarySearch: returns the index of a given number in a sorted array of numbers where all numbers are unique
- bubbleSort: sorts numbers in an array using the bubble sort method
- mergeSort: sorts numbers in an array using the merge sort method
- heapSort: sorts numbers in an array using the heap sort method
