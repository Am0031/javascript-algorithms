# javascript-algorithms

In this project we are writing simple functions and corresponding tests using node.js and the jest package

## Functions in the project

Numbers:

- oddOrEven: check if number is odd or event
- isPerfectSquare: check if a number is a perfect square number or not
- isPrimeNumber: check if a number is a prime number
- linearSearch: returns the index of the first occurence of a given number in an array of numbers, or -1 if the given number is not in the array
- factorial: returns the factorial of a given positive number, or 1 when given 0, or undefined when given a negative number
- mostSongs: return the maximum number of elements present in the array, with a maximum sum of 60
- fizzBuzz: goes through the numbers 1 to 100 and for each number: replaces it by `Fizz` if the number is divisable by num1, replaces it by `Buzz` if the number is divisable by num2, replaces it by `FizzBuzz` if the number is divisable by both num1 and num2, or keeps the number itself, and then returns the complete string of results for all numbers.

Strings:

- isAnagram: check if two strings are anagrams (same letters)
- camelCase: changes the format of a string to a camel case format

Arrays:

- isUnique: check if array contains only unique numbers
- arraySearch2D: returns the number of times a specific character
  is present in the 2D array
- largestNumber: returns the largest number in an array of numbers
- productOfLargestTwo: finds the largest two numbers in an array and returns the product of these numbers
