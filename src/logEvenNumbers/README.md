# Log Even Nums

In this activity you will be writing code to create a function that prints even numbers from 0 to a given number.

## Instructions

- Open [Unsolved/log-even-nums.js](Unsolved/log-even-nums.js) in your code editor&mdash;this is the only file you will modify in this activity.

  - In this file you will be writing code in the body of the `logEvenNums` function to achieve the following:

    - Print all even numbers from `0` up to the given `nums` argument, inclusive.

      - For example, given the number `6` as the `num` argument, the following should be printed to the console, one log at a time:

        ```bash
        0
        2
        4
        6
        ```

- You can check to see if your function works properly by opening [Unsolved/test.html](Unsolved/test.html) in your web browser.

  - Functions that pass the tests will be denoted with a green check mark.

  - Functions that fail the tests will be denoted with a red X and an error message.
