# Sum Array

In this activity you will be writing code to create a function that adds up all the numbers in a given array and returns the total.

## Instructions

- Open [Unsolved/sum-array.js](Unsolved/sum-array.js) in your code editor&mdash;this is the only file you will modify in this activity.

  - In this file you will be writing code in the body of the `sumArray` function to achieve the following:

    - Add all of the numbers in the given `arr` array argument and return the total.

      - See the following array for an example:

        ```js
        var arr = [3, 1, 5, 6];
        ```

      - Given the preceding array, the following number should be returned:

        ```js
        15;
        ```

- You can check to see if your function works properly by opening [Unsolved/test.html](Unsolved/test.html) in your web browser.

  - Functions that pass the tests will be denoted with a green check mark.

  - Functions that fail the tests will be denoted with a red X and an error message.
