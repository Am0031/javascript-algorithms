# Sum Array

In this activity we will be writing code to create a function that adds up all the numbers in a given array and returns the total.

## Details

We will be writing code in the body of the `sumArray` function to achieve the following: add all of the numbers in the given `arr` array argument and return the total.

See the following array for an example:

```js
const arr = [3, 1, 5, 6];
```

Given the preceding array, the following number should be returned:

```js
15;
```
