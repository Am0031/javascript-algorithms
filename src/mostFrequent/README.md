# Max Num

In this activity, the challenge is to create a function that returns the largest number present in a given array.

## Details

We will be writing code in the body of the `largestNumber` function to achieve the following: return the largest number present in the given array.

See the following array for an example:

```js
const array = [3, 1, 17, 5, 6];
```

Given the preceding array, the following number should be returned:

```js
const result = 17;
```
