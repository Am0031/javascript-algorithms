# Most Frequent

In this activity, the challenge is to create a function that returns the most frequent number present in a given array.

## Details

We will be writing code in the body of the `mostFrequent` function to achieve the following: return the most frequent number present in the given array.

The aim is to use hash tables to achieve this.

See the following array for an example:

```js
const array = [-4, 1, 5, -16, 3, -42, 0, 5, 5];
```

Given the preceding array, the following result should be returned:

```js
const result = { key: 5, value: 3 };
```
