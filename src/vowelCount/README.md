# Vowel Count

In this activity we will be writing code to create a function that counts the number of vowels in a given string.

## Details

We will be writing code in the body of the `vowelCount` function to achieve the following: return the number of vowels present in `str`.

See the following string for an example:

```js
const str = "open a new browser tab";
```

Given the preceding string, the following should be returned:

```js
7;
```
