# Bubble sort

In this activity we will be writing code to create a function that sorts an array using the bubble sort method.

## Details

We will be writing code in the body of the `bubbleSort` function to achieve the following:

- sort the numbers in the given array in ascending order.
- return the sorted array.

See the following array for an example:

```js
const arr = [10, 20, 9, 6, 3];
```

Given the preceding array, the following product should be returned:

```js
const sortedArr = [3, 6, 9, 10, 20];
```
