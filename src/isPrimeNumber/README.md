# Is Prime Number

In this activity we will be writing code to create a function that takes in a whole number, then returns `true` if the number is a prime number, and otherwise returns `false`.

## Details

We will be writing code in the body of the `isPrimeNumber()` function to achieve the following:

- If `num` is a prime number, return `true`. Otherwise, return `false`.

- A prime number is a number that is not the product of smaller numbers.

- See the following number for an example:

      ```js
      const num = 11;
      ```

- Given the preceding number, `true` should be returned.

- See the following number for another example:

      ```js
      const num = 50; // Product of 5 and 10
      ```

- Given the preceding number, `false` should be returned.
