# Max Num

In this activity, you will be writing code to create a function that returns the largest number present in a given array.

## Instructions

Open [Unsolved/max-num.js](Unsolved/max-num.js) in your code editor&mdash;this is the only file you will modify in this activity.

  - In this file you will be writing code in the body of the `maxNum` function to achieve the following:

    - Return the largest number present in the given `arr` array.

      - See the following array for an example:

        ```js
        var arr = [3, 1, 17, 5, 6];
        ```

      - Given the preceding array, the following number should be returned:

        ```js
        17;
        ```

- You can check to see if your function works properly by opening [Unsolved/test.html](Unsolved/test.html) in your web browser.

  - Functions that PASS the tests will be denoted with a green check mark.

  - Functions that FAIL the tests will be denoted with a red X and an error message.
