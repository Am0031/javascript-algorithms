# Plus One

In this activity, the challenge is to create a function that takes in an array of digits representing a non-negative integer and add 1 to it. The digits are arranged such that the most significant digits are on the left and each element in the array contains a single integer digit.

## Details

We will be writing code in the body of the `plusOne` function to achieve the following:

- Add 1 to the digits array, then modify and return the original array.

- Do this without using any Array methods, such as `.join` or `.split`.

See the following array for an example:

```js
const arr = [1, 2, 3];
```

Given the preceding array, the following result should be returned:

```js
const result = [1, 2, 4];
```

See the following array for an example:

```js
const arr = [9];
```

Given the preceding array, the following result should be returned:

```js
const result = [1, 0];
```
