# Is Palindrome

In this activity we will be writing code to create a function that takes in a string and determines whether or not it is a palindrome. A **palindrome** is any string spelled the same forwards as it is backwards.

## Details

We will be writing code in the body of the `isPalindrome` function to achieve the following:

- Return `true` if the given string is a palindrome.

- Return `false` if the given string is not a palindrome.

- See the following string for an example:

  ```js
  const str = "racecar";
  ```

- Given the preceding string, the following should be returned:

  ```js
  const result = true;
  ```
