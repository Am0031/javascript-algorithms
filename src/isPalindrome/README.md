# Is Palindrome

In this activity you will be writing code to create a function that takes in a string and determines whether or not it is a palindrome. A **palindrome** is any string spelled the same forwards as it is backwards.

## Instructions

* Open [Unsolved/is-palindrome.js](Unsolved/is-palindrome.js) in your code editor&mdash;this is the only file you will modify in this activity.

  * In this file you will be writing code in the body of the `isPalindrome` function to achieve the following:

    * Return `true` if the given string is a palindrome.

    * Return `false` if the given string is not a palindrome.

      * See the following string for an example:

        ```js
        var str = "racecar";
        ```

      * Given the preceding string, the following should be returned:

        ```js
        true;
        ```

* You can check to see whether your function works properly by opening [Unsolved/test.html](Unsolved/test.html) in your web browser.

  * Functions that pass the tests will be denoted with a green check mark.

  * Functions that fail the tests will be denoted with a red X and an error message.
