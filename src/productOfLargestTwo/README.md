In this activity you will be writing code to create a function that finds the largest two numbers in an array and returns the product of both numbers.

## Instructions

* Open [Unsolved/product-of-largest-two.js](Unsolved/product-of-largest-two.js) in your code editor&mdash;this is the only file you will modify in this activity.

    * Find the largest and the second largest numbers in the given array.

    * Return the product of the largest and the second largest number.

    * See the following array for an example:

      ```

    * Given the preceding array, the following product should be returned:

      ```js
      200
      ```

    * **Note:** The given array will always contain at least two elements.

* You can check to see if your function works properly by opening [Unsolved/test.html](Unsolved/test.html) in your web browser.
