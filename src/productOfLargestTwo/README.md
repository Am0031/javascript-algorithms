# Product of Largest Two

In this activity, the challenge is to create a function that finds the largest two numbers in an array and returns the product of both numbers.

## Details

We will be writing code in the body of the `productOfLargestTwo` function to achieve the following:

- Find the largest and the second largest numbers in the given array.

- Return the product of the largest and the second largest number.

See the following array for an example:

```js
const arr = [10, 20, 9, 6, 3]; // largest is 20, secondLargest is 10
```

Given the preceding array, the following product should be returned:

```js
200;
```

**Note:** The given array will always contain at least two elements.
