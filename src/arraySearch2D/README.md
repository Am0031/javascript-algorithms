# Array Search 2D

In this activity, the challenge is to create a function that takes in a two-dimensional (2D) array and searches each 2D element for the character `X` and returns the number of times `X` appears in the 2D array.

## Details

We will be writing code in the body of the `arraySearch2D()` function to achieve the following:

- Return the total number of occurrences of the string `"X"` (capitalized) inside the 2D array.

- See the following 2D array for an example:

      ```js
      var arr = [
        ["X", "O", "O", "O", "X", "O"],
        ["O", "X", "O", "O", "O", "O"],
        ["O", "O", "O", "O", "X", "X"],
        ["O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O"]
      ]
      ```

- Given the preceding array, the number `5` should be returned.

- **Note**: Make sure we're looking for capital X.
