# Title Case

In this activity you will be writing code to create a function that capitalizes the first letter of every word in a given string.

## Instructions

* Open [Unsolved/title-case.js](Unsolved/title-case.js) in your code editor&mdash;this is the only file you will modify in this activity.

  * In this file you will be writing code in the body of the `titleCase` function to achieve the following:

    * Return a string identical to the given `str` string, but with the first letter of each word capitalized.

    * See the following string for an example:

      ```js
      var str = "open a new browser tab";
      ```

    * Given the preceding string, the following should be returned:

      ```js
      "Open A New Browser Tab";
      ```

* You can check whether your function works properly by opening [Unsolved/test.html](Unsolved/test.html) in your web browser.

  * Functions that pass the tests will be denoted with a green check mark.

  * Functions that fail the tests will be denoted with a red X and an error message.
