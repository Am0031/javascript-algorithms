# Title Case

In this activity, the challenge is to create a function that capitalizes the first letter of every word in a given string.

## Details

We will be writing code in the body of the `titleCase` function to achieve the following: return a string identical to the given `str` string, but with the first letter of each word capitalized.

See the following string for an example:

```js
const str = "open a new browser tab";
```

Given the preceding string, the following should be returned:

```js
"Open A New Browser Tab";
```
