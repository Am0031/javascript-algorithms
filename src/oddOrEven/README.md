# Odd or Even

In this activity, we will be writing code to create a function that determines whether a number is odd or even.

## Examples

See the following number for an example:

```js
const num = 30; // number is even - remainder is 0 when divided by 2
```

Given the preceding number, the following should be returned:

```js
const result = "even";
```

See the following number for an example:

```js
const num = 17; // number is odd - remainder is 1 when divided by 2
```

Given the preceding number, the following should be returned:

```js
const result = "odd";
```
