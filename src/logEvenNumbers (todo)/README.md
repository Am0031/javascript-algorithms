# Log Even Nums

In this activity we will be writing code to create a function that prints even numbers from 0 to a given number.

## Details

We will be writing code in the body of the `logEvenNums` function to achieve the following: print all even numbers from `0` up to the given `nums` argument, inclusive.

For example, given the number `6` as the `num` argument, the following should be printed to the console, one log at a time:

```bash
        0
        2
        4
        6
```
