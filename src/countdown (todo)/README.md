# Countdown

In this activity we will be writing code to create a function that prints all whole numbers from `num` to a given number.

## Details

We will be writing code in the body of the `countdown` function to achieve the following: print all numbers from the given `num` argument to `1`, inclusive.

For example, given the number `10` as the `num` argument, the following should be printed to the console, one log at a time:

```bash
      10
      9
      8
      7
      6
      5
      4
      3
      2
      1
```
