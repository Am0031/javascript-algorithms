# Camel Case

In this activity you will be writing code to create a function that takes a string and returns the string in camel case.

## Instructions

* Open [Unsolved/camel-case.js](Unsolved/camel-case.js) in your code editor&mdash;this is the only file you will modify in this activity.

  * In this file you will be writing code in the body of the `camelCase` function to achieve the following:

    * Return a camel case version of the given string.

    * A string is in camel case when there are no spaces between words, the first letters of each word except the first word is capitalized, and all other letters are in lowercase.

    * See the following string for an example:

      ```js
      var str = "let the force flow through you";
      ```

    * Given the preceding example, the following string should be returned:

      ```js
      "letTheForceFlowThroughYou";
      ```

* You can check to see if your function works properly by opening [Unsolved/test.html](Unsolved/test.html) in your web browser.

  * Functions that pass the tests will be denoted with a green check mark.

  * Functions that fail the tests will be denoted with a red X and an error message.
