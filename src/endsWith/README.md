# EndsWith - Confirm the end of a string

In this activity, the challenge is to create a function that takes in a string and determines whether or not this string ends with the given target string of letters.

## Details

We will be writing code in the body of the `endsWith` function to achieve the following:

- Return `true` if the given string ends with the given target.

- Return `false` if the given string does not end with the given target.

- See the following string and target for an example:

  ```js
  const string = "Open sesame";
  const target = "same";
  ```

- Given the preceding string, the following should be returned:

  ```js
  const result = true;
  ```

Note: we will aim to resolve this without using the endsWith() function available with ES2015.
