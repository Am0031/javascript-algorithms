# Is Unique

In this activity, the challenge is to create a function that takes an array of numbers and returns `true` if no number appears more than once in the given array; else, it returns `false`.

## Examples

See the following array for an example:

```js
const arr = [2, 8, 7, 5, 4, 19]; // no number is repeated
```

Given the preceding array, the following should be returned:

```js
const result = true;
```

See the following array for an example:

```js
const arr = []; // no number is repeated - array is empty
```

Given the preceding array, the following should be returned:

```js
const result = true;
```

See the following array for an example:

```js
const arr = [3, 8, 5, 3, -1, 17, 15, 26]; // 3 appears twice
```

Given the preceding array, the following should be returned:

```js
const result = false;
```
