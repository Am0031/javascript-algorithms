# Character Count

In this activity, we will write code to create a function that takes a string and returns an object containing the characters in the string and the number of times they appear.

## Details

We will write code in the body of the `characterCount` function to achieve the following:

- Create a new object.

- Loop through each character in the given string and create a new key for each character in the string.

- The value of the character's key should be the number of times it appears in the string.

  - See the following function for an example:

    ```js
    const str = "Hello World!";
    ```

  - Given the preceding function, the following object should be returned:

    ```js
    { H: 1, e: 1, l: 3, o: 2, ' ': 1, W: 1, r: 1, d: 1, '!': 1 }
    ```
