# Factorial

In this activity, the challenge is to create a function that returns the factorial of a given number. A **factorial** of a number is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to the number. For more information, see the [Wikipedia page on factorials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial).

## Details

We will be writing code in the body of the `factorial` function to achieve the following: return the factorial of the given `num` integer.

we will assume that the given number is a a whole positive number.

See the following code for an example:

```js
const num = 3;
```

Given the preceding number, the following should be returned:

```js
//  product of numbers from 1 to given number 3: 1 x 2 x 3 === 6
const result = 6;
```

If given the number `0`, the factorial should be `1`.

If given the number `1`, the factorial should also be `1`.

If given a negative number, the factorial should return "undefined".
