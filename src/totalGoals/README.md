# Total goals

In this activity, the challenge is to create a function that checks football league data, which we will assume was received from a third party api (from json file here), and extract from it the total number of goals that a given team has scored that year.

## Examples

See the following team name for an example:

```js
const team = "everton";
```

Given the preceding team name, the following should be returned:

```js
const result = 48;
```

See the following team name for an example:

```js
const team = "astonvilla";
```

Given the preceding team name, the following should be returned:

```js
const result = 31;
```

See the following team name for an example:

```js
const team = ""; // empty string
```

Given the preceding team name, the following should be returned:

```js
const result = "Not a valid team name";
```
