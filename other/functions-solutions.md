# JavaScript algorithms to practice - Functions - Solutions

These are the solutions I worked out for some of the practice algorithms questions compiled in the [functions.md](functions.md) file. There might be other and more efficient ways to resolve the questions.

Note: I worked out my solutions in Codepen so the expected return is provided by a console.log as shown below, but the output could be obtained differently, for example confirmed by a jest test or rendered in the browser.

1. Write a JavaScript function that reverse a number.
