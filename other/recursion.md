# JavaScript algorithms to practice - Recursion

Use recursion to solve the following exercises.

1. Write a JavaScript program to calculate the factorial of a number.
   In mathematics, the factorial of a non-negative integer n, denoted by n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. For example, 5! = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120

2. Write a JavaScript program to find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two positive numbers.

3. Write a JavaScript program to get the integers in range (x, y).
   Example : range(2, 9)
   Expected Output : [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]

4. Write a JavaScript program to compute the sum of an array of integers.
   Example : var array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
   Expected Output : 21

5. Write a JavaScript program to compute the exponent of a number.
   Note : The exponent of a number says how many times the base number is used as a factor.
   82 = 8 x 8 = 64. Here 8 is the base and 2 is the exponent.

6. Write a JavaScript program to get the first n Fibonacci numbers.
   Note : The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, . . . Each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two.

7. Write a JavaScript program to check whether a number is even or not.

8. Write a JavaScript program for binary search.
   Sample array : [0,1,2,3,4,5,6]
   console.log(l.br_search(5)) will return '5'

9. Write a merge sort program in JavaScript.
   Sample array : [34,7,23,32,5,62]
   Sample output : [5, 7, 23, 32, 34, 62]
